# ðŸ§º Market Basket Analysis Using FP-Growth (Databricks + PySpark)

This project performs Market Basket Analysis on a retail transactions dataset using the FP-Growth algorithm in PySpark, within the Databricks platform.

## ðŸš€ Objective
Uncover frequent itemsets and association rules from customer transaction data to support strategic business decisions such as product placement and bundling.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Format: CSV
- Source: Groceries dataset
- Description: Each row contains a unique customer transaction listing purchased items.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- PySpark
- Databricks (Community Edition)
- FP-Growth (MLlib)
- Spark SQL

## ðŸ§  Methodology
1. Data loaded and preprocessed in Spark.
2. Transactions grouped and nulls removed.
3. FP-Growth algorithm applied to detect frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
4. Rules sorted by confidence for business relevance.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

### ðŸ”„ Chord Diagram of Association Rules

This visualization displays the relationships between items in the form of directional association rules.  
- **Blue arrows** represent outgoing rules: `Antecedent â†’ Consequent`  
- **Red arrows** show incoming rules: `Consequent â†’ Antecedent`  
It helps identify central items influencing many other purchases.

- **Bar Chart**: Top 10 most frequently purchased items across all transactions.
- **Pie Chart**: Top 10 association rules ranked by **Lift**, showing strong co-occurrence patterns like:
  - `{rolls/buns, other vegetables} â†’ {whole milk}`
  - `{sausage, rolls/buns} â†’ {whole milk}`

These insights support potential strategies for cross-selling and product bundling.
